//given a list of n strings
//strings consists of digits and spaces
//no. of spaces equal in n strings
//variation of sort command
//no space in begin, end, no consecutive spaces
//key: column to be used as sorted
//reversed: true or false
//comparison-type: lexigraphical or numeric

//logic:
//1) extract keys from every string (tokenization) pair<string, key)
//2) sorting, 2 comparators: lexicographical or numerical
//3) reverse
