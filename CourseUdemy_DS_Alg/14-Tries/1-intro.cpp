//words={"apple", "ape", "mango", "news", "no"}
//queries={"apple", "banana", "new", "mango"}

//yes, no, no, yes

//1-brute force
//2-insert DS (e.g.: BST)
//3-unorderedSet (hashing)
//4-tries search: (O(w) -> tamanho da palavra) / Insert O(w)

//what is a trie?
//1- generic tree like DS
//2- efficient retrieval DS
